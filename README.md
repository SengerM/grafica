# Unified Plotting Interface

My personal unified interface for doing plots. The idea is to wrap any plotting package (Matplotlib, Plotly, etc.) with a simple and single interface, at least for "basic everyday" plots.

### Maxims

The maxims to guide the development of this package are:

- The interface tries to capture the "concept" of each kind of plot rather than its drawing details.
- The interface is simple and easy without complicated details.

This is an evolution of [myplotlib](https://github.com/SengerM/myplotlib).
